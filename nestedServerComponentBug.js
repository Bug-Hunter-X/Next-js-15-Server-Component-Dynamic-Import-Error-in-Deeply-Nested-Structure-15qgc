In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with dynamic imports within a deeply nested component structure.  The issue manifests as a runtime error, often a TypeError or a ReferenceError, indicating that a module imported dynamically within a server component is not available or properly resolved. This might occur because the server component's context or the way Next.js handles dynamic module resolution during the server-side rendering process is affected by the nesting depth.
