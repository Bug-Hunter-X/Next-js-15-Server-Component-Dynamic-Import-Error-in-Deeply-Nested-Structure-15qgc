Several solutions exist depending on the specific circumstances. One approach is to refactor the component structure to reduce nesting depth or move the dynamic import to a less nested component.  Another solution involves restructuring the application to make dynamic imports less reliant on the nested structure's context.   For more complex scenarios, you might need to adjust the way modules are loaded or explore techniques like server-side caching to prevent repeated module resolution failures.
