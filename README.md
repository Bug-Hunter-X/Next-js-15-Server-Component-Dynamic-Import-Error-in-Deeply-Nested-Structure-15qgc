This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 related to dynamic imports within deeply nested server components.  The bug manifests as runtime errors (TypeErrors or ReferenceErrors) when a module imported dynamically is not properly resolved due to the nested structure. The solution involves refactoring the component structure or using a different approach to handle dynamic imports to ensure proper module resolution.
